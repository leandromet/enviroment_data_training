If you have **2 hours** for your **online class on Climate Change and One Health**, you can go deeper into concepts, include more interactive activities, and even add a **hands-on GIS exercise** (if feasible). Hereâ€™s an expanded, engaging structure:  

---

### **Class Title:**  
**"Climate Change & One Health: Bridging Science, Policy, and Indigenous Knowledge"**  

### **Format:**  
- **Online (Google Meet)**  
- **Duration:** 2 hours (more discussion, group work, and GIS practice)  
- **Tools:**  
  - **Google Meet** (breakout rooms, screen sharing)  
  - **Mentimeter/Poll Everywhere** (live polls)  
  - **Google Jamboard** (collaborative brainstorming)  
  - **QGIS/ArcGIS Online** (interactive demo)  
  - **Padlet** (for sharing resources and final reflections)

### **Expanded 2-Hour Class Plan**  

#### **1. Introduction (15 min) â€“ Setting the Stage**  
- **Icebreaker Poll (Mentimeter):**  
  - *"Whatâ€™s one way climate change has impacted health in your region?"* (Word cloud)  
- **Brief Overview:**  
  - Define **One Health** (human-animal-environment connections).  
  - Explain **climate change as a threat multiplier** (e.g., zoonotic diseases, food security, mental health).  
  - Introduce your **PhD work** (Indigenous lands in Brazil/Canada) as a case study.  

#### **2. Key Concepts (30 min) â€“ Interactive Lecture + Case Studies**  
- **Climate Change & Health Linkages:**  
  - **GIS & Disease Spread:** Show maps of **temperature shifts and malaria/dengue expansion**.  
  - **Forestry & Biodiversity:** How deforestation (Amazon/Boreal) increases spillover risk (e.g., Nipah, Lyme).  
  - **Indigenous Knowledge:** How traditional fire management, agroforestry, and land stewardship enhance resilience.  
- **Case Studies:**  
  - **Your Research:** GIS visualization of land-use changes in Indigenous territories.  
  - **Global Example:** Arctic thawing and zoonotic pathogens (e.g., anthrax re-emergence).  

#### **3. Group Activity (40 min) â€“ Scenario-Based Problem Solving**  
- **Breakout Rooms (3-4 people, mixed disciplines)**  
- **Two Scenarios (groups pick one):**  
  1. *"An Indigenous community in the Amazon reports more snakebites and waterborne diseases after extreme floods. How would you assess and address this using a One Health approach?"*  
  2. *"A Canadian Arctic village sees an outbreak of a rare parasite in sled dogs and children. How could climate change be a factor, and what interventions would you propose?"*  
- **Groups prepare a 5-min pitch (using Jamboard or slides) on solutions.**  
- **Report back & discussion (20 min total).**  

#### **4. GIS Practical Demo (30 min) â€“ Hands-On Exploration**  
- **Option 1 (Basic â€“ Demo Only):**  
  - Show **real-time climate-health data** (e.g., NASA Earth Data, HealthMap).  
  - Overlay deforestation, temperature, and disease cases.  
- **Option 2 (Interactive â€“ If Participants Have GIS Skills):**  
  - Share a **pre-prepared QGIS project** (e.g., land-cover change + disease outbreaks).  
  - Guide them through **basic analysis** (e.g., buffer zones around deforested areas).  

#### **5. Policy & Action Discussion (15 min)**  
- **Quick Debate:**  
  - *"Should Indigenous knowledge be formally integrated into climate-health policy? Why or why not?"*  
- **Call to Action:**  
  - Share **free tools** (FAO One Health Toolkit, NASA Earth Observations).  
  - Discuss **career paths** in climate-health intersections.  

#### **6. Wrap-Up & Reflection (10 min)**  
- **Padlet Board:**  
  - *"Whatâ€™s one thing you learned today that changes how you see your role in One Health?"*  
- **Final Q&A + Resource Sharing** (links to datasets, your research, further reading).

### **Why This Works for 2 Hours:**  
âœ… **Deeper Learning:** More time for discussions, case studies, and GIS work.  
âœ… **More Interaction:** Two group activities (breakout + GIS) keep engagement high.  
âœ… **Practical Skills:** GIS demo adds a tangible skill component.  
âœ… **Policy & Career Relevance:** Links science to real-world decision-making.  

### **Adaptations Based on Audience Skills:**  
- **If GIS is new:** Focus on **demo + interpretation** (not hands-on).  
- **If advanced:** Assign a **mini-challenge** (e.g., "Find a hotspot of climate-health risk").  

Would you like help designing the **GIS dataset** or **breakout room guides**? I can tailor this further based on your studentsâ€™ backgrounds! ðŸŒ¿ðŸŒŽ
