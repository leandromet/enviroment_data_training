Planning a **1-hour online class** on **Climate Change and One Health** for a **multidisciplinary audience** (biologists, vets, undergrad/grad students) requires an engaging, interactive, and practical approach. Given your **meteorology, GIS, forestry, and sustainability expertise**, you can design a dynamic session that connects climate science with One Health (human-animal-environment interactions).  

Here‚Äôs a structured plan to maximize participation and understanding:  

---

### **Class Title:**  
**"Climate Change & One Health: Connecting the Dots with GIS, Indigenous Knowledge, and Sustainability"**  

### **Format:**  
- **Online (Google Meet)**  
- **Duration:** 1 hour (interactive, with polls, breakout discussions, and GIS demo)  
- **Tools:**  
  - Google Meet (screen sharing for slides & GIS demo)  
  - Mentimeter/Poll Everywhere (for live polls)  
  - Google Jamboard (for collaborative brainstorming)

### **Class Outline:**  

#### **1. Introduction (10 min) ‚Äì Setting the Stage**  
- **Icebreaker Poll (Mentimeter):**  
  - *"When you hear 'One Health and Climate Change,' what comes to mind?"* (Word cloud)  
- **Brief Overview:**  
  - Define **One Health** (human-animal-environment health links).  
  - Explain how **climate change disrupts ecosystems** (e.g., zoonoses, deforestation, extreme weather).  
  - Mention your **PhD work on Indigenous lands** (Brasil/Canada) as a case study.  

#### **2. Key Concepts (15 min) ‚Äì Interactive Lecture**  
- **Climate Change Impacts on One Health:**  
  - **GIS & Remote Sensing:** Show a **heatmap/drought index** affecting disease vectors (e.g., malaria expansion).  
  - **Forestry & Biodiversity Loss:** How deforestation (Amazon/Boreal forests) increases zoonotic spillover.  
  - **Indigenous Knowledge:** How traditional practices enhance resilience (e.g., fire management, agroforestry).  
- **Case Study (Your Research):**  
  - Share a **short GIS visualization** (e.g., land-use change in Indigenous territories affecting health).  

#### **3. Practical Activity (20 min) ‚Äì Breakout Discussions**  
- **Divide into small groups (Google Meet breakout rooms)** with mixed disciplines.  
- **Scenario-Based Task:**  
  - *"A community in the Amazon is facing increased dengue outbreaks due to rising temperatures and deforestation. As a One Health team (biologists, vets, GIS experts), propose solutions."*  
  - Groups report back in 2-3 min each.  

#### **4. GIS Demo (10 min) ‚Äì Hands-On Insight**  
- **Quick Demo (QGIS/ArcGIS Online):**  
  - Show a **real-time climate-health dataset** (e.g., NASA Earth Data on temperature & disease vectors).  
  - Let students suggest variables to overlay (e.g., deforestation + wildlife migration).  

#### **5. Q&A + Closing (5 min)**  
- **Final Poll:** *"What‚Äôs one action you can take in your field to address climate-health risks?"*  
- **Call to Action:** Share resources (e.g., FAO One Health Toolkit, your research papers).

### **Why This Works:**  
‚úÖ **Engagement:** Polls, breakout rooms, and GIS demo keep it dynamic.  
‚úÖ **Multidisciplinary:** Links climate science, ecology, vet medicine, and Indigenous knowledge.  
‚úÖ **Practical:** GIS demo shows real-world tools; case studies make it relatable.  
‚úÖ **Your Expertise Shines:** Highlights your PhD work while making complex topics accessible.
